  art: 'Glyphite.com was born out of a desire to easily create beautiful text for games. There were no tools to build rich, gorgeous, effect-laden fonts for games and we decided to fill that gap. Using this web-app, you could layer shadows, strokes, and fills to create stunning font sprites.',

  love: 'We offered this advanced tool on a donation model because we believed games should just have better fonts!',

  play: 'My then-partner and I had a blast building this and told the world about it at the Game Developerâ€™s Conference in San Francisco in 2014. We dove in and created marketing materials, blog posts, booth displays, and a green-screen experience where people could pose for a picture, pick a backdrop, and add Glyphite-stylized text. It was well-received but our day jobs pulled us away from the project, and it fizzled shortly after.',
