    | My portfolio spans two lives: pre-2016 as Samer Chahine, a Software Engineer looking for wealth with a popular app or a Big Tech job, and post-2016 as bubbles sandcastle, Samer reborn with a dedication to love and free expression. #[br] #[br] While I‚Äôm not artistically talented in a traditional sense, I am artisanal by nature and so I tend towards designing novel combinations of artistic elements. The shader backgrounds on this site are the perfect example: beautiful pieces of mathemetical art generously offered freely on the internet, perfect as atmospheric mood.

  love: 'The universe has shown me that my life and all its privileges are only possible because of the bravery and effort of others. On all my sites, I create a gratitude page thanking those who helped bring beauty and ease to my work. My wish is that this portfolio makes you smile‚Äîmaybe even stand in awe ü§©‚Äîand if, like me, you are inspired towards heart-centered work, I hope that you hire me to help!',

  play: 'I designed this portfolio to mimic the supremely popular ‚ÄúTikTok‚Äù feed format. Even though I don‚Äôt use social media, the design is irresistably fun! My creations always feature playful elements‚Äîfun animations, bold colors, easter eggs and surprises‚Äîin hopes of bringing a bit of vibrancy and enchantment to technology. We can build so much more than productivity apps and mindless games with these incredible gadgets, and I strive to prove that in everything I create.',
